# Project Brief: MadPlan

## Executive Summary
MadPlan is a Kanban-style project management application that emulates the core functionality of Trello but distinguishes itself with a whimsical and enchanting visual theme inspired by the art style of Studio Ghibli. The primary problem it solves is the sterile, uninspiring nature of typical productivity tools, aiming to provide a more calming and creative environment for users. The target market includes creative professionals, students, and small teams who value aesthetics and a positive user experience in their digital tools. The key value proposition is offering robust task management functionality within a uniquely beautiful and engaging interface.

## Problem Statement
Current project management tools, while functional, are often visually monotonous and corporate in design. This can lead to a sense of detachment, user fatigue, and even creative burnout. Users, particularly in creative fields, lack a tool that is both powerful for organization and inspiring to use. Existing solutions force a trade-off between robust functionality and aesthetic appeal. The problem is significant as a user's digital environment can directly impact their mood, productivity, and creativity. Solving this now is crucial as the demand for personalized and more human-centric software continues to grow.

## Proposed Solution
MadPlan will be a web-based application offering a familiar Kanban board interface (boards, lists, and cards) for task management. The core concept is to blend this proven productivity workflow with a hand-crafted, Ghibli-inspired art style. This includes themed backgrounds, custom UI elements with a hand-drawn feel, and subtle animations that create a delightful user experience. The key differentiator is this deep integration of an enchanting aesthetic, making the act of organizing tasks feel less like a chore and more like curating a personal workspace. This solution will succeed by attracting users who are currently uninspired by the clinical design of market leaders like Trello and Asana.

## Target Users
### Primary User Segment: Creative Professionals & Students
- **Profile:** Graphic designers, writers, artists, developers, and students who manage multiple projects or courses. They are tech-savvy and appreciate well-designed software.
- **Needs & Pains:** They need to organize complex projects and ideas visually but are often uninspired by the rigid, corporate feel of existing tools. They desire a workspace that reflects their creative personality.

### Secondary User Segment: Hobbyists & Personal Organizers
- **Profile:** Individuals organizing personal projects, hobbies (e.g., novel writing, event planning), or daily life tasks.
- **Needs & Pains:** They want a simple, visual way to track progress but find traditional to-do lists unengaging. A beautiful interface would make personal organization more enjoyable and motivating.

## Goals & Success Metrics
### Business Objectives
- Acquire 1,000 active users within the first 3 months post-launch.
- Achieve a 40% user retention rate after the first month.
- Establish a strong brand identity in the niche of "aesthetic productivity tools."

### User Success Metrics
- High task completion rate, indicating users are effectively managing their work.
- Frequent creation of new boards and cards, showing active engagement.
- Positive qualitative feedback regarding the user interface and overall experience.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **DAU/MAU (Daily Active Users/Monthly Active Users):** To measure user stickiness.
- **User Satisfaction (NPS Score):** To gauge user sentiment and loyalty.
- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of visitors who sign up for an account.

## MVP Scope
### Core Features (Must Have)
- **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login.
- **Board Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete boards.
- **List Management:** Within a board, users can create, view, edit, reorder, and delete lists.
- **Card Management:** Within a list, users can create, view, edit, and delete cards.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for reordering cards between and within lists, and for reordering lists within a board.
- **Basic Ghibli Theme:** A single, high-quality Ghibli-inspired theme (e.g., a background, custom card/list styles) will be applied across the application.

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Team collaboration features (inviting members, assigning cards).
- Advanced card features (checklists, attachments, due dates, comments).
- Multiple themes or customization options.
- Integrations with third-party applications (Power-Ups).
- Calendar view or other alternative data visualizations.

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered successful if users can seamlessly perform all core CRUD operations for boards, lists, and cards, and if early user feedback validates the appeal of the Ghibli-style aesthetic as a key differentiator.

## Post-MVP Vision
### Phase 2 Features
- Introduce team collaboration features.
- Add advanced card details like due dates, checklists, and attachments.
- Offer a small selection of different Ghibli-inspired themes.

### Long-term Vision
Develop a "Theme Marketplace" where artists can contribute and sell their own aesthetic themes. Introduce "Power-Ups" that add functionality with a whimsical twist (e.g., a "Totoro" timer for Pomodoro technique).

### Expansion Opportunities
- Mobile application development (iOS/Android).
- Integration with other creative tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, or Scrivener.
- A desktop version with offline capabilities.

## Technical Considerations
### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Web Responsive (functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers).
- **Browser/OS Support:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Performance Requirements:** The application must remain fast and responsive, ensuring that the aesthetic elements do not compromise performance.

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** Vue 3
- **Backend:** Nest.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** To be determined, but likely a cloud provider like Vercel (frontend) and AWS/Heroku (backend).

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Polyrepo (separate directories for the frontend and backend).
- **Service Architecture:** API communication will be handled via GraphQL.
- **Security/Compliance:** Standard security practices for user data protection will be implemented.

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- **Budget:** To be determined.
- **Timeline:** MVP launch targeted for 6 months from project start.
- **Resources:** Initial development by a small, focused team.

### Key Assumptions
- Users are willing to trade a small number of advanced features (initially) for a superior aesthetic experience.
- The Ghibli-inspired theme will be a strong enough differentiator to attract an initial user base.
- The chosen tech stack will be sufficient to support the performance and scalability needs of the application.

## Risks & Open Questions
### Key Risks
- **Performance vs. Aesthetics:** The heavy use of custom styles and potentially animations could negatively impact performance. (High Impact)
- **Scope Creep:** Strong temptation to add more features to the MVP to compete with Trello, which would delay launch. (High Impact)
- **Intellectual Property:** The visual style must be "inspired by" and not a direct copy of Studio Ghibli's IP to avoid legal issues. (Medium Impact)

### Open Questions
- What specific visual elements (e.g., color palettes, character styles, environmental themes) are most essential for capturing the "Ghibli" feel?
- How will the GraphQL schema be structured to optimize communication between the Vue 3 frontend and Nest.js backend?
- What is the most effective user acquisition strategy for this niche market?

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions
1.  Conduct a focused design sprint to create key art and a component style guide for the Ghibli theme.
2.  Develop a detailed PRD based on this brief, including user stories and epics for the MVP.
3.  Set up the polyrepo structure and initialize the Vue 3 and Nest.js projects.

### PM Handoff
This Project Brief provides the full context for MadPlan. The next step is to transition to the Product Manager to begin the PRD generation process. Please review this brief thoroughly and work with the user to create a detailed PRD, section by section, asking for any necessary clarification and ensuring all MVP features are broken down into actionable epics and stories.
