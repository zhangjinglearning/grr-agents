# MongoDB Atlas Security Considerations

## Current Development Configuration

### Database User
- **Username**: madplan_dev_db_user
- **Permissions**: Read and write to any database
- **Password**: Secure password generated (stored in setup guide)

### Network Access
- **Current Setting**: 0.0.0.0/0 (Allow access from anywhere)
- **Purpose**: Development environment access
- **Security Level**: Development only - NOT suitable for production

## Production Security Recommendations

### IP Whitelist Restrictions
When moving to production, replace 0.0.0.0/0 with specific IP addresses:
- Application server IP addresses
- Developer workstation IPs (if needed)
- CI/CD pipeline IP addresses

### Database User Permissions
For production, consider:
- Creating role-specific users (read-only for analytics, write for app)
- Implementing principle of least privilege
- Regular password rotation

### Connection Security
- Always use SSL/TLS connections (mongodb+srv://)
- Keep connection strings in environment variables
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use MongoDB Atlas built-in encryption at rest

### Monitoring and Auditing
- Enable MongoDB Atlas monitoring
- Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
- Review access logs regularly
- Monitor for failed authentication attempts

## Environment Variable Security
- Use `.env` files locally (never commit)
- Use secure environment variable management in production
- Consider using secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

## Current Status: Development Ready âœ…
The current configuration is appropriate for development and testing. Security hardening required before production deployment.
